I mostly support efforts (and thus conduct\r\nresearch regarding) water quality and enforcement issues. I am quite\r\ninterested in the quality of EPA’s environmental data and do my best to\r\nhelp people understand our data sets. I also study the potential for\r\ngaming of environmental data. We do not maintain personal websites at\r\nwork, so this is what I am creating instead.\r\nI am an occasional blogger at John Whitehead and Tim Haab’s Environmental Economics but I intend to blog\r\non this space using Distill and Rmarkdown to show examples of the kind\r\nof work I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
