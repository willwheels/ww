My current CV is [here](https://github.com/willwheels/R-vitae/blob/master/wheeler-cv.pdf)

My CV is written in Rmarkdown and generated using a slightly modified version of a LaTex template created by [Ryan Peek](https://d-rug.github.io/blog/2017/Ryan-Peek-on-creating-a-CV-using-Rmarkdown), which is in turn based on a template by [Steven Miller].(http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/)
